                        Mosaics are mostly created from small evenly colored tiles and where already created in ancient
                        Rome and Greece. The process of creating mosaics with wood patches instead of colored tiles is
                        usually called parquetry. Finding the best wood patches for these kinds of mosaics can be difficult
                        and time-consuming, while leaving only al little margin of error. To address these problems Iseringhausen et al.<a href="#1">[1]</a>
                        created an algorithm for patch-based image generation, that is constrained in its limitation of
                        resources, and allows the fabrication of these images with real world materials.
                    </p>

    <div class="docs-section" id="Motivation">
        <h3 class="section-heading">Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            While the approach of Iseringhausen et al.<a href="#1">[1]</a> created parquetry by dividing a picture into a grid of quadratic patches and then altering
            them based on the edges in the picture, this project tries to solve the problem of creating parquetry by utilizing
            different tessellations. The idea of this approach is to approximate the edges within the picture, not by deforming the
            edges of each patch but instead by using pattern consisting of different regular geometric shapes. By using shapes with straight edges,
            the patches remain simple to cut and can be manufactured without the use of CnC machines, while also generating a picture that looks less
            discretized compared to a grid pattern.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="docs-section" id="Algorithm">
        <h3 class="section-heading">Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
            The algorithm first load the config and pattern files. Then it starts preprocessing of the pictures. The program
            matches the histogram of the target picture and the cumulated histogram of all source textures and interpolates
            the new picture with the original picture. This step aligns the color spaces of target and source picture and allows
            for a better use of the source textures. Then a filtered image is created for each picture by using an edge filter.
            The histogram matching and creation of filter images where suggested in the paper from Iseringhausen et al.<a href="#1">[1]</a> to
            to increase the quality of the resulting picture. <br>
            Before the target picture is turned into patches based on the provided pattern, the program creates rotated versions of
            the source textures. Adding rotated versions of source textures removes the need to rotate each patch in every step of the patch search because
            the algorithm just needs to search on every rotated texture to include rotated wood patches.<br>
            When the preprocessing is done, the patches are ordered priority in which they are computed. The priority consists
            of the distance from the patch to the center of the image and the average of the salience values contained in the patch.
            The salience values of each pixel is calculated by using the salience filter form OpenCV. After ordering the patches by priority
            they are distributed on a thread pool. The algorithm then uses a greedy approach to look for the best wood patch.<br>
            When all wood patches are found, the program generates the cut and assembly maps and creates an artificial picture of the parquetry.

            The algorithm was applied to a set of different pictures with varying tessellations.

            The figures 2 to 6 show the results of the algorithm with different tessellations with figure 1 as the target picture.
            All results where computed with the same wood textures.

        <p> As a template for a produced piece of parquetry I choose the picture shown in figure 9. The background
            of the picture was turned white to prevent the background from fusing with the rest of the picture. I generated
            two pictures with a different amount of wood patches shown in figure 10 and 11. To keep the cutting time reasonably low
            I choose the picture in figure 1 for production.
            The individual wood veneer used for the production where between 1 and 2 mm thick and most of them where to brittle
            for cutting with the band saw shown in figure 12.
            To reinforce the wood pieces they were glued to 2 mm thick plywood. Then the wood cut be cut into pieces and each part
            took 1-3 minutes to manufacture. The production of all 280 wood patches took about 6-7h of sawing time.
            Assembly of the patches in figure 13 took additional 1-2 hours. The final result is displayed in figure 14.

        <h3 class="section-heading">Conclusions and future work</h3>
        <p>
            The use of tessellations other than a tesselation out of squares usually results in better looking parquetry but
            can also lead to weird artifacts depending on the picture and tesselation used.
            The amount of detail achieved by the project does not quite reach the results Iseringhausen et al.<a href="#1">[1]</a>
            achieved with their approach, but the cuts that need to be made to manufacture the patches are way simpler.
            Approximating edges within a patch by splitting the patch into two separate patches would probably have improved the quality of the pictures,
            while an approach of merging adjacent patch could have kept the amount of parts to a minimum. The time of this
            project was too short to implement these features, and there is a chance that the pictures could have looked
            worse because both features would destroy the regularity of the tesselation. Nevertheless, these features would be
            interesting additions for future improvements.

    <div class="docs-section" id="How to use">
        <h3 class="section-heading">How to use</h3>
        <h4>1. Preparations</h4>
        <p>
            Before starting you need to choose the resources the program should work with. The project contains already some examples, so if you want to try it first you can skip this step and revisit it later.
        </p>

        <h5>Picking a target picture</h5>
        <p>
            There are no limitations when picking a target picture, but there are some suggestions about which pictures usually result in a better recognizable image:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faces (human or animal) or parts of them(e.g. an eye) are in most cases better recognizable than other pictures</li>
            <li>Pictures with fewer components are better in most cases so try to choose a cat before a gray background over a crowd of people or a patch of grass.</li>
            <li>The program mostly cares about differences in brightness. Therefore, a person with green clothes could merge with a red background. Most of these cases should be solved with the integrated histogram matching, but try to choose picture where the individual components differ in brightness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Getting the (wood-)textures</h5>
        <p>TL;DR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan the material and get the DPI of it.</li>
            <li>Mark unwanted parts of the image black.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why is the wood in the heading in parentheses, you ask? While this project was focused on using wood, other materials like pictures, colored paper or newspaper can also result in an interesting collages. But whatever material you choose, you need to turn it into a digital image. For this, scanning it with a scanner should be your first choice. It gives you an evenly exposed image and can calculate the exact size of your wood by using the DPI and image size. For pieces that are too big for a regular scanner, cutting it into smaller pieces is probably the best choice. Whatever method you choose, get the DPI of the picture, because it will be needed later.
            <br><br>
            If your texture contains parts that you don't want in your end result, take an image editing tool of your choice and paint these parts black(Hex color 0x000000). Every thing in this color will be excluded from the search process.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Compile and run</h4>
        <h5>Requirements</h5>
        <p>
            (Skip this step if you use the already compiled binary and head to Running the program)
            <br><br>
            Compiling the project requires:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GCC / G++</li>
            <li>CMAKE</li>
            <li>Boost</li>
            <li>OpenCV</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For installing it on Ubuntu you can use the following command in the terminal:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>sudo apt update && sudo apt install \
build-essential \
cmake \
libboost-dev \
libopencv-dev \        </code>
        </pre>
        <h5>Compiling (on Ubuntu)</h5>
        <p>
            (Skip this step if you use the already compiled binary and head to Running the program)
            <br><br>
            To compile it with CMAKE, run these commands in the root directory of the project:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make        </code>
        </pre>
        <h5>Running the program</h5>
        <p>
            After compiling it (or you use the compiled binary in the bin directory of the project) you can run the program with:
        </p>
        <code>
            ./PictureToWood [config path] [pattern path]
        </code>
        <p>
            <br>
            or
        </p>
        <code>
            ./PictureToWood_x64 [config path] [pattern path]
        </code>
        <p><br>The config path is required for the program to run, the pattern path can also be defined in the config file.</p>

        <h4>4. Print and production tips</h4>
        <h5>Adjust DPI</h5>
        <p>
            OpenCV will save the cut masks always as a 96 DPI image, even if you set the DPI in the config file to a different value. The mask will be generated with the DPI you specified but you need to change the DPI value manually.
            <br><br>
            Example(with Paint.net): The cut mask resolution was set to 300 DPI in the config file.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the image with Paint.net
            </li>
            <li>Go to "Image->Resize" or press CTRL+R
            </li>
            <li>Go to "Resolution" and set the unit to "pixel/inch"
            </li>
            <li>Replace the number in the resolution field with 300
            </li>
            <li>Save the picture (not all file formats will support dpi)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Printing it in real size</h5>
        <p>
            Your assembly map may be bigger than the maximum page size you can print. In this case you can use Paint to print your image over multiple pages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the image in Paint
            </li>
            <li>Go to "File->Print->Page Setup"
            </li>
            <li>Under Scaling, select the Point "To 100%"
            </li>
            <li>Click OK
            </li>
            <li>Print the image from Paint, and make sure to select “All Pages”
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Applying the mask</h5>
        <p>
            If you have a hard time to align your cut mask on your wood, think about drilling little holes in 3 corners of the wood and paint them black in your scanned image. The black masks will also be printed on your cut mask, so you can align the printed marks with holes you drilled.
            <br><br>
            If you want to apply the mask to the backside of your wood, set one of the flipping option in the config file on true. If you flip it make sure you flip your wood in the right way, flipping left-to-right(vertical) is different from flipping up-to-down(horizontal). If used holes for aligning you can use the to make sure your mask is in the right orientation after flipping.        </p>
        <h5>Cutting</h5>
        <p>
            While cutting make sure you are cutting away only the black border of each piece. Everything white on the inside of the border is part of your piece so try to cut nothing from it. The line pointing from a corner to the inside of your is an orientation marker for assembling the pieces so leave this line out while cutting.        </p>
        <h5>Assembly</h5>
        <p>
            For assembling the parts you can print out the assembly map, like described in Printing it in real size. Then you can just put your pieces on the corresponding field of your map. Make sure the lines pointing to the inside of your piece match the line on the map to achieve the right rotation of your piece.
